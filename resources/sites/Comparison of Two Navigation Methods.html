Comparison of the Human Model and Potential Field Method for Navigation</h1></center>
&nbsp; Before starting to compare the two methods, you may first want to
check the following links for a step by step construction of the formulas
of both methods to gain insight about their specific properties. The step
by step constructions make it very easy to understand how the parameters
in the formulas can be used to tune the performance:

</ul>
&nbsp; Let's begin by looking at a typical performance demonstration of
both methods in an example scene:

<p>&nbsp; Having seen a typical example, we can now discuss some major
differences between these two navigation methods:
</p><ul>
<li>
The first major (and immediately noticed) difference of the human model
from the potential field method is the following: The obstacle part of
the human model formula has two parts; one taking the distance into account,
and the other taking the direction of the obstacle into account. On the
other hand, the obstacle part of the potential field method has only one
part (distance). Therefore we observe the following behaviors:</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
The human model effectively uses the direction part to steer away from
obstacles without getting very close to them, provided that the parameters
of <b>both parts</b> are carefully adjusted. This results in very smooth
paths that really resemble how humans prefer to steer (hence, the human
model).</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
An agent using the potential field method should first approach an obstacle
close enough to produce a repulsive force that is large enough to balance
the attractive force so that the agent can start to steer away.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<blockquote>The obstacle parts of both methods are shown below:</blockquote>

</tbody></table></center>

<br>&nbsp;
<ul>The following two experiments demonstrate the mentioned behaviors:</ul>

</td>

<td valign="TOP" nosave="">
<br>In the first experiment, I tried to adjust the distance part of the
potential field method to match with the distance part of the human model
(the emphasis is on the influence distance). I did not change the parameters
of the human model which were well-tuned for this experiment.
<p>In the graph on the left side, the distance part of the human model
is plotted with red, and falls to zero around 3.5 meters. So, I used 3.5
meters as rho_0 (object influence distance) for the potential field method.
The resulting distance part of the potential field is plotted with blue
in the same graph.
</p><p>The parameters for the human model were:
<br>B = 3.25, K = 2.5, G1 = 3, G2 = 0.5, E1 = 8, E2 = 4, O1 = 10, O2 =
1.6
<br>(E2 is lower than the usual value (7), to account for the "width" of
the obstacle, i.e.&nbsp; to get a collision-free run.)
</p><p>And the following were the assignments for potential field method parameters:
<br>k_p = 1, eta = 1, rho_0 = 3.5
</p><p>The result of the simulation is given below:</p></td>

</p><p>As seen in the figure, the obstacle repulsive force has a large magnitude,
but a small lateral component (due to the nearly "head-on" approach to
the obstacle), so the agent should come close enough to the obstacle before
the repulsive force lateral component can steer the agent away.</p></td>

<td>The second experiment is in fact aimed to give its fair share back
to the potential field method, and demonstrate the importance of tuning
<b>both
parts</b> of the obstacle component of the human model together (tuning
each part in isolation did not work very well in my experiments).
<p>This time, I tried to adjust the distance part of the human model to
match with the distance part of the potential field method. The parameters
of the potential field method were the ones that I usually used in my simulation
experiments:
</p><p>k_p = 1, eta = 1, rho_0 = 0.8
</p><p>The graph on the left side shows the distance part of the potential
field method in blue. The influence distance is 0.8 meters. So I tried
to have a similar influence distance (as close as possible) for the human
model by playing with the O2 parameter (result is shown in red).
</p><p>The parameters for the human model were:
<br>B = 3.25, K = 2.5, G1 = 3, G2 = 0.5, E1 = 8, O1 = 10, O2 = 7

</td>

<td>All the geometric settings are the same with the first example. And
again, the common translation speed used for both methods is 0.5 m/s.
<p>Magenta path is traversed with human model ( E2 = 1 ).
<br>Orange path is traversed with human model ( E2 = 0.5 ). (As we try
to correct the behavior, we are getting worse results, and the path starts
looking more like the path of potential field method. Similar sudden rotations
start to occur.)
<br>Cyan path is traversed with potential field method, and the agent will
continue with the white path under the control of potential field method.
</p><p>The dark green vector shows the repulsive force of obstacle, the dark
blue vector shows the attractive force of the target, and the purple vector
is the resultant vector. The darkgray circle is the object influence region
for the potential field method.
</p><p>As seen in the figure, if the distance part is not tuned properly, trying
to correct the behavior of the human model by modifying parameters of the
direction part does not suffice. The influence distance is too small for
the human model in this example (and it is not collision-free if you take
the width of the agent into account), but potential field method is always
collision free (unless, of course, the influence region is set to 0 meters).</p></td>

</tbody></table></center>

<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Speed is not taken into consideration in the human model. Because of this,
the agent traverses different paths if different constant translation speeds
are applied, with all other parameters being the same. The reason for this
behavior is that, when the agent enters a region in which it should have
a non-zero rotation acceleration, the agent is being subjected to this
acceleration effect for a longer time if the speed is lower. An example
is given below:</li>
</ul>

<br>&nbsp;
<center><table border="" cellpadding="10" width="100%" nosave="">
<tbody><tr nosave="">
<td nosave="">
<center><img src="./Comparison of Two Navigation Methods_files/HM_speed_effect.gif" nosave="" height="523" width="670"></center>
</td>

<td>Room dimensions: 5 x 6.5 meters
<br>Smaller tick mark period = 10 cm
<br>Larger tick mark period = 100 cm
<p>Green dot is an obstacle.
<br>Blue dot is the target.
<br>Agent starts in lower left corner with heading = 0 degrees (facing
+x axis)
</p><p>Magenta path is traversed with 1.0 m/s constant translation speed.
<br>Cyan path is traversed with 0.25 m/s constant translation speed.
</p><p>For the magenta path: the agent started a positive (counter clockwise)
rotation towards the target, but since it was fast, it only had a small
time to rotate (and a small total rotation). And then the obstacle influence
pushed the agent downwards.
</p><p>For the cyan path: the agent started the same positive rotation towards
the target and before the influence of the obstacle took effect, it made
a large enough turn, so that the further influence of the obstacle pushed
the agent upwards this time.
</p><p>&nbsp; On the other hand, even though speed is also not directly taken
care of by the potential field method, since the potential field method
basically provides just the directions to move in, the agent always traverses
the same path under different speeds.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table></center>

<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
The human model has a notion of acceleration and deceleration. It also
has a damping term that effectively controls acceleration. This also makes
the human model paths much more smoother. The potential field method commanded
paths may easily involve many sharp turns depending on how complex the
artificial potential field created by the target and obstacles is (which
usually is composed of many hills and valleys even if there are only three
or four obstacles). The example scene, and the paths above clearly show
this difference.<br>
<br></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The human model obstacle-avoidance-part is based on exponential influence-decay,
and the potential field method obstacle-avoidance-part is based on the
(1/distance) squared influence-decay. Therefore, in potential field method,
it is impossible for the agent to crash into an obstacle, but in human
modal, this is sometimes possible (even if the parameters are carefully
tuned). This immediately reveals one advantage and one disadvantage of
the human model over potential field method:</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
<b>Advantage</b>: Local minima is not a very big problem for the human
model. With a constant speed, the agent will, in almost all cases, pass
through a critical region (probably overshooting the target), reach a stable
condition, and continue to rotate towards the target and approach the target.
("Critical regions" are the places where local minimas occur for potential
field methods.) Also the notion of a local minima is very different for
the human model. For potential field methods, it is very easy to set up
a local minima (for example, simpy block the direct path to target with
obstacles placed on a concave polygon around the agent as demonstrated
in the figure below), but for the human model, setting up a local minima
is not an easy task. (Actually I was not able to set up one). The agent
always uses either the cancelling effect (explained below) to pass between
the obstacles (if O2 parameter is high) or takes an outside path (if O2
parameter is low). The special design of the human model formula makes
it easy for the agent to steer to the target easily. In this sense, the
human model can be considered as a global navigation scheme rather than
a local navigation scheme, which seems to be a very powerful feature.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Disadvantage</b>: While the agent is passing through critical regions,
if the placement of obstacles and/or target is such that they have cancelling
contributions to the agent's computed rotation acceleration (which was
very common in my trials) , then the agent may well run into obstacles.
This is actually due to the reason that the human model acts on a point
as the agent (does not take care of the "width" of the agent). The point
representing the agent actually never runs over an obstacle point (although
it is not 100% guaranteed. The potential field method formula is actually
constructed specially to have a 100% guarantee for this, by extending the
forces to infinity.) This is not a big problem, since it is always possible
to have the agent take an outside path and reach the target, but in some
cases, it may be desirable to have the agent navigate between the obstacles
rather than move around them.</li>

<p><br>The following figure demonstrates the mentioned advantage and the
disadvantage of the human model:</p></ul>

<td>Room dimensions: 5 x 6.5 meters
<br>Smaller tick mark period = 10 cm
<br>Larger tick mark period = 100 cm
<p>Green dots are obstacles.
<br>Blue dot is the target.
<br>Agent starts in lower left corner with heading = 0 degrees (facing
+x axis)
</p><p>In all of the runs, the constant translation speed was 0.5 m/s.
</p><p>White path shows the local minima effect for the potential field method.
The agent is stuck in a "bowl" trying to find a way out, by moving around
in circles. This is one type of a local minima for the potential field
method. Another type is just having zero magnitude force and getting "freezed"
in a location where the attractive and repulsive forces cancel each other.
</p><p>Cyan path is traversed with the human model (O2 = 1.6) The influence
regions of the obstacles are not very large, and since there are obstacles
on both sides of the agent, their net contribution to the rotation acceleration
calculation becomes negligible along the path, and the agent tries to pass
between them.
</p><p>Magenta path is also traversed with the human model (O2 = 0.8) The influence
regions of the obstacles are large, and they force the agent to take an
outside path.</p></td>
